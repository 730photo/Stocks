# Lab: React Router & APIs

For today's lab you will be building a stock tracking app. The lab will be broken down into two parts...
  1. Build a React app that uses `react-router`
  2. Communicate with 3rd-party and local APIs

> **NOTE:** This app runs on Port 3001. This is configured inside [`package.json`](package.json)

## Part I: [React Router](part-i.md)

If you want to see what a finished version of Part I might look like...

```bash
$ git checkout solution-routing-only
$ npm run start
```

## Part II: [Adding APIs](part-ii.md)

If you want to see what a finished version of Part II might look like, first make sure to [clone down and run the Rails API](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-router-lab-api). Then...

```bash
$ git checkout solution-routing-apis
$ npm run start
```
